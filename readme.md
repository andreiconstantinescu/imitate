api-angel
=========

`api-angel` is a REST API mocking tool. It offers a simple workflow for proxying your existing API, caching requests into a persistent file, and then using that file to stub your real API.

`api-angel` is useful for end-to-end testing, offline-development, and other situations where you want to access a close (but no cigar) copy of your real REST API. It is agnostic to your choice of backend or frontend.
